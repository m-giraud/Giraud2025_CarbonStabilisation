# Part 2: Main program flow

This main program flow is implemented in the `main` function
of the program which is defined in the file `main.cc` described below. Additionally, we can see how to implement an adaptive grid with a saturation-dependent indicator.

The code documentation is structured as follows:

[[_TOC_]]


## The file `main.cc`

<details open>
<summary><b>Click to hide/show the file documentation</b> (or inspect the [source code](../main.cc))</summary>


This is the main file for the 2pinfiltration example. Here we can see the programme sequence and how the system is solved using Newton's method
### Included header files
<details><summary> Click to show includes</summary>

```cpp
#include <config.h>

// Standard header file for C++, for in- and output.
#include <iostream>
```

A Dune helper class for enabling parallel simulations with MPI

```cpp
#include <dune/common/parallel/mpihelper.hh>
```

In Dumux, a property system is used to specify the model. For this, different properties are defined containing type definitions, values and methods. All properties are declared in the file properties.hh. Additionally, we include the parameter class, which manages the definition of input parameters by a default value, the inputfile or the command line.

```cpp
#include <dumux/common/properties.hh>
#include <dumux/common/parameters.hh>
#include <dumux/common/initialize.hh>
```

We include the linear solver to be used to solve the linear system and the nonlinear  Newton's method

```cpp
#include <dumux/linear/istlsolvers.hh>
#include <dumux/linear/linearsolvertraits.hh>
#include <dumux/linear/linearalgebratraits.hh>
#include <dumux/nonlinear/newtonsolver.hh>
```

Further, we include assembler, which assembles the linear systems for finite volume schemes (box-scheme, tpfa-approximation, mpfa-approximation) and a file that defines the different differentiation methods used to compute the derivatives of the residual

```cpp
#include <dumux/assembly/fvassembler.hh>
#include <dumux/assembly/diffmethod.hh>
```

We need the following class to simplify the writing of dumux simulation data to VTK format.

```cpp
#include <dumux/io/vtkoutputmodule.hh>
```

The gridmanager constructs a grid from the information in the input or grid file.

```cpp
#include <dumux/io/grid/gridmanager_alu.hh>
```

We include several files which are needed for the adaptive grid

```cpp
#include <dumux/adaptive/adapt.hh>
#include <dumux/adaptive/markelements.hh>
#include <dumux/adaptive/initializationindicator.hh>
#include <dumux/porousmediumflow/2p/griddatatransfer.hh>
#include <dumux/porousmediumflow/2p/gridadaptindicator.hh>
```

Finally, we include the properties which configure the simulation

```cpp
#include "properties.hh"
```

</details>

### The main function
At the beginning of the simulation, we create an alias for our problem type tag, for which we have
defined the properties of our simulation (see `properties.hh`). Additionally, we have to create an
instance of `Dune::MPIHelper` and parse the run-time arguments:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv) try
{
    using namespace Dumux;

    // we define the type tag for this problem
    using TypeTag = Properties::TTag::PointSourceExample;

    // (maybe) initialize MPI and/or multithreading backend
    Dumux::initialize(argc, argv);
    const auto& mpiHelper = Dune::MPIHelper::instance();

    // Construct parameter tree from command line arguments (and input file if given in the arguments)
    Parameters::init(argc, argv);
```

#### Create the grid
The `gridManager` creates a grid from our parameter choices in the input file (which could be a grid
file or specified domain dimensions and number of cells, as done in this example).

```cpp
    GridManager<GetPropType<TypeTag, Properties::Grid>> gridManager;
    gridManager.init();

    // The instationary non-linear problem is run on this grid.
    //
    // we compute on the leaf grid view
    const auto& leafGridView = gridManager.grid().leafGridView();
```

#### Set-up of the problem
We build the finite volume geometry, which allows us to iterate over subcontrolvolumes (scv) and
subcontrolvolume faces (scvf) embedded in the elements of the grid partition.

```cpp
    using GridGeometry = GetPropType<TypeTag, Properties::GridGeometry>;
    auto gridGeometry = std::make_shared<GridGeometry>(leafGridView);
```

In the problem, we define the boundary and initial conditions and compute the point sources.
The `computePointSourceMap` function is inherited from `FVProblem` (see `dumux/common/fvproblem.hh`).
It calls the `addPointSources` method, which is empty per default, but can be overloaded in user problems.
As we have seen, in this example we do specify a point source (see `problem.hh`).

```cpp
    using Problem = GetPropType<TypeTag, Properties::Problem>;
    auto problem = std::make_shared<Problem>(gridGeometry);
    problem->computePointSourceMap();
```

We initialize the solution vector (all primary variables on the grid) and then use it to initialize the
`gridVariables`, which provide access to both primary & secondary variables (per sub-control volume).

```cpp
    using SolutionVector = GetPropType<TypeTag, Properties::SolutionVector>;
    SolutionVector x;
    problem->applyInitialSolution(x);
    auto xOld = x;

    using GridVariables = GetPropType<TypeTag, Properties::GridVariables>;
    auto gridVariables = std::make_shared<GridVariables>(problem, gridGeometry);
    gridVariables->init(x);
```

##### Grid adaption
The following piece of code shows how we instantiate an indicator class which determines where to adapt the grid,
and a data transfer class that maps a solution to an adapted grid.

```cpp
    using Scalar = GetPropType<TypeTag, Properties::Scalar>;
    const Scalar refineTol = getParam<Scalar>("Adaptive.RefineTolerance");
    const Scalar coarsenTol = getParam<Scalar>("Adaptive.CoarsenTolerance");
    // We use an indicator for a two-phase flow problem that is saturation-dependent.
    // It is defined in the file `dumux/porousmediumflow/2p/gridadaptindicator.hh.`
    // and allows to set the minimum and maximum allowed refinement levels via the input parameters.
    TwoPGridAdaptIndicator<TypeTag> indicator(gridGeometry);
    // The data transfer performs the transfer of data on a grid from before to after adaptation
    // and is defined in the file `dumux/porousmediumflow/2p/griddatatransfer.hh`.
    // Its main functions are to store and reconstruct the primary variables.
    TwoPGridDataTransfer<TypeTag> dataTransfer(problem, gridGeometry, gridVariables, x);
```

Convenience functions to perform a grid adaptation given a pre-calculated indicator.

```cpp
    const auto adaptGridAndVariables = [&] (auto& indicator) {
        // We mark and adapt the elements according to the indicator.
        bool wasAdapted = false;
        if (markElements(gridManager.grid(), indicator))
            wasAdapted = adapt(gridManager.grid(), dataTransfer);

        // In case of any adapted elements, the gridvariables and the pointsourcemap are updated.
        if (wasAdapted)
        {
            // We overwrite the old solution with the new (resized & interpolated) one
            xOld = x;
            // We initialize the secondary variables to the new (and "new old") solution
            gridVariables->updateAfterGridAdaption(x);
            // we update the point source map after adaption
            problem->computePointSourceMap();
        }
    };
```

We do initial refinements around sources/BCs, for which we use the `GridAdaptInitializationIndicator` defined in `dumux/adaptive/initializationindicator.hh`.
Afterwards, depending on the initial conditions, another grid adaptation using our `indicator` above might be necessary, which uses
`Adaptive.RefineTolerance` and `Adaptive.CoarsenTolerance` for this step.

```cpp
    GridAdaptInitializationIndicator<TypeTag> initIndicator(problem, gridGeometry, gridVariables);
    const auto maxLevel = getParam<std::size_t>("Adaptive.MaxLevel", 0);
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < maxLevel; ++i)
    {
        initIndicator.calculate(x);
        adaptGridAndVariables(initIndicator);
    }
    indicator.calculate(x, refineTol, coarsenTol);
    adaptGridAndVariables(indicator);
```

[[/codeblock]]
#### Solving the problem
We get some time loop parameters from the input file params.input

```cpp
    using Scalar = GetPropType<TypeTag, Properties::Scalar>;
    const auto tEnd = getParam<Scalar>("TimeLoop.TEnd");
    const auto maxDt = getParam<Scalar>("TimeLoop.MaxTimeStepSize");
    const auto dt = getParam<Scalar>("TimeLoop.DtInitial");
```

and initialize the vtkoutput. Each model has a predefined model specific output with relevant parameters for that model.

```cpp
    using IOFields = GetPropType<TypeTag, Properties::IOFields>;
    VtkOutputModule<GridVariables, SolutionVector> vtkWriter(*gridVariables, x, problem->name());
    using VelocityOutput = GetPropType<TypeTag, Properties::VelocityOutput>;
    vtkWriter.addVelocityOutput(std::make_shared<VelocityOutput>(*gridVariables));
    IOFields::initOutputModule(vtkWriter); // Add model specific output fields
    vtkWriter.write(0.0);
```

We instantiate the time loop

```cpp
    auto timeLoop = std::make_shared<TimeLoop<Scalar>>(0, dt, tEnd);
    timeLoop->setMaxTimeStepSize(maxDt);
```

and set the assembler with the time loop because we have an instationary problem

```cpp
    using Assembler = FVAssembler<TypeTag, DiffMethod::numeric>;
    auto assembler = std::make_shared<Assembler>(problem, gridGeometry, gridVariables, timeLoop, xOld);
```

We set the linear solver and the non-linear solver

```cpp
    using LinearSolver = AMGBiCGSTABIstlSolver<LinearSolverTraits<GridGeometry>,
                                               LinearAlgebraTraitsFromAssembler<Assembler>>;
    auto linearSolver = std::make_shared<LinearSolver>(leafGridView, gridGeometry->dofMapper());

    using NewtonSolver = Dumux::NewtonSolver<Assembler, LinearSolver>;
    NewtonSolver nonLinearSolver(assembler, linearSolver);
```

##### The time loop
We start the time loop. In each time step before we start calculating a new solution we check if we have to refine the mesh again based on the solution of the previous time step. If the grid is adapted we update the gridvariables and the pointsourcemap. Afterwards, the solution of that time step is calculated.

```cpp
    timeLoop->start(); do
    {
        // We only want to refine/coarsen after first time step is finished, not before.
        // The initial refinement was already done before the start of the time loop.
        // This means we only refine when the time is greater than 0. Note that we now also
        // have to update the assembler, since the sizes of the residual vector and jacobian matrix change.
        if (timeLoop->time() > 0)
        {
            indicator.calculate(x, refineTol, coarsenTol);
            adaptGridAndVariables(indicator);
            assembler->updateAfterGridAdaption();
        }

        // We solve the non-linear system with time step control.
        nonLinearSolver.solve(x, *timeLoop);

        // We make the new solution the old solution.
        xOld = x;
        gridVariables->advanceTimeStep();

        // We advance to the time loop to the next step.
        timeLoop->advanceTimeStep();

        // We write vtk output for each time step
        vtkWriter.write(timeLoop->time());

        // We report statistics of this time step
        timeLoop->reportTimeStep();

        // We set a new dt as suggested by the newton solver for the next time step
        timeLoop->setTimeStepSize(nonLinearSolver.suggestTimeStepSize(timeLoop->timeStepSize()));

    } while (!timeLoop->finished());
```

The following piece of code prints a final status report of the time loop
before the program is terminated and we print he dumux end message

```cpp
    timeLoop->finalize(leafGridView.comm());

    // print dumux end message
    if (mpiHelper.rank() == 0)
        Parameters::print();

    return 0;
} // end main
```

### Exception handling
In this part of the main file we catch and print possible exceptions that could
occur during the simulation.
<details><summary> Click to show exception handler</summary>

```cpp
// errors related to run-time parameters
catch (const Dumux::ParameterException &e)
{
    std::cerr << std::endl << e << " ---> Abort!" << std::endl;
    return 1;
}
catch (const Dune::Exception &e)
{
    std::cerr << "Dune reported error: " << e << " ---> Abort!" << std::endl;
    return 3;
}
catch (...)
{
    std::cerr << "Unknown exception thrown! ---> Abort!" << std::endl;
    return 4;
}
```
